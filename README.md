### Hey you
I am not a programmer, I guess. Btw, I don't even know what I do here lol. \
~~Haha im a code thief uwu~~

I can program in JavaScript and Python, and I'm kinda learning C/C++. I learn by just starting a project and take help from the internet while programming, though I waste most of the time procrastinating. Not a way to learn effectively, innit? :P

I'd also love to learn music making (I really only ever made remakes, no originals), digital art, 3D modelling and animation, and electronics stuff, but ugh, *procrastination*

I might have ADHD/OCD/<insert any other mental disorders whose symptoms are social anxiety, not talkative, short attention span, likes fidgeting, hoarding shit, jumping emotions, etc etc>. I'm introverted, and I really suck at planning and time management.

If you have any questions, you can ask me in the given socials or in the issues tab :D
